Milestone 2 Stuff,

1.1 Feature Selection,
- We'll try using the same features as the first milestone but we'll add or remove features later on if we're not getting a good score.

1.2 Mapping the features,
- Manthan will do this.

1.3 Balancing the classes
- For each class with a lot of rows, randomly remove rows.
- Evan can look into this.

1.4 Building Models
- Evan is gonna do boosting trees.

1.5 Overfitting
- Compare train vs. validation. If train accuracy is a lot higher then we're probably overfitting.

1.6 Comparssion
- Just need to discuss and compare results for our models.

1.7 Prediciton
- Just run the best performing model on the test dataset.
