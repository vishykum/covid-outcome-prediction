# CMPT 459 Group Project Milestone 2 README

We use several third party libraies in our code. See below for the list of libraries and the commands used to install them

* Pandas -> pip install pandas   
* Seaborn -> pip install seaborn
* Matplotlib -> pip install matplotlib
* Scikit Learn -> pip install -U scikit-learn
* XGBoost -> pip install xgboost

Note that we used python version 3.9.15 during our development. Please use this version (or similar 3.9.*) in order to accurately replicate our results.

Also note that our program takes quite a long time to run. In our testing it took about 15-20 minutes on average with most of the time spent during the building of the models.
